            <name>Artichokes</name>
            <canningMethod>This kitchen project delivers both flavor and texture unlike any store-bought artichokes. Home-canned, marinated artichoke hearts liven up pizza, a salad or a sandwich.

                Beware: The tannins in raw artichoke will stain your hands. Lemon juice will remove the stain.

                You'll need 3 sanitized pint jars with new lids and rings; see the NOTE, below.

                Make Ahead: The artichokes need 1 month to cure, during which time their texture changes from firm to velvety while their structure is retained. If you choose to skip the water-bath canning called for here, refrigerate the sealed jars of artichokes for 1 month before serving. (Artichokes that are not water-bath-canned will not achieve the same silky texture as those that are.) The water-bath-canned jars of artichokes need to cool for 12 hours. They are shelf stable for 1 year. Once opened, the jars should be refrigerated and used within a month.SERVINGS: 9 - 15

                Yield: (makes 3 pints)

                INGREDIENTS
                4 lemons
                9 medium or 15 baby artichokes
                1/4 cup plus 3 teaspoons kosher salt or sea salt
                1 cup distilled white vinegar, plus more as needed
                1/4 cup white wine vinegar
                1/4 cup mild olive oil, or more as needed
                1 tablespoon dried oregano
                3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
                3 cloves garlic, root ends trimmed
                Three 1-inch strips lemon zest

                DIRECTIONS
                Halve and juice the lemons. Place the spent lemon halves in a 5-quart nonreactive (not aluminum or copper) pot; fill it with cold water. Strain and reserve the juice for the marinade.

                To trim the artichokes, pull the leaves from each one, snapping them where they naturally break. Use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler to peel the choke, then make a clean cut across the end of the stem, retaining the tender portion. Use a grapefruit spoon, melon baller or side of a teaspoon to scrape away the fuzzy choke, revealing the meaty part of it, then quarter the entire choke. (For baby artichokes, trim only to any inner leaves without a thorn.) As each choke is trimmed, drop it into the pot.

                Add 1/4 cup of salt. Bring the pot filled with lemon water and artichokes to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so the water is barely bubbling. Cook, uncovered, until fork-tender, about 10 minutes.

                Meanwhile, make the marinade: Combine the reserved lemon juice, vinegars, oil, oregano, crushed red pepper flakes and garlic cloves in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil; cook for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat.

                Use a slotted spoon to transfer the artichokes to the sanitized jars, dividing evenly and stacking the small ones and first cutting the medium ones into quarters. Tuck them in as tightly as possible without breaking or bruising.

                Whisk the marinade well and divide among the jars. If there is not enough marinade to cover, add oil as needed to leave 1/2 inch headspace at the top of each jar. Make sure 1 garlic clove, 1 strip of lemon zest and 1 teaspoon salt goes into each jar.

                Run a chopstick or flat plastic knife along the inside of the jar to remove any air bubbles. Clean the rim of each jar with distilled white vinegar to cut residual oils, place the warmed lids on and finger-tighten the rings (not too tight). Process in the boiling water bath for 15 minutes (see NOTE, below). Turn off the heat and let the jars rest in the pot for 10 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the jars to a clean, folded dish towel to cool over several hours.

                Store the water-bath-canned jars in a cool space to cure for 1 month.

                NOTE: Water-bath canning safely seals high acid, low pH foods in jars. The time for processing in the water-bath is calculated based on the size of the jar and the consistency and density of the food. For safety's sake, do not alter the jar size, ingredients, ratios or processing time in any canning recipes. If moved to change any of these items, simply put the prepared food in the refrigerator and eat within a week.

                Fill a large canning kettle or deep stockpot two-thirds full with water. To keep the jars from rattling against the pot, place a rack in the pot (a cake rack works well, or a folded dish towel is equally effective). Sanitize the jars in a short dishwasher cycle or by boiling them in a canning kettle or pot for 10 minutes. Fill a small saucepan with water and add the rings. Bring to a boil over high heat, slip in the lids and turn off the heat.

                Use a jar lifter or tongs to lower the filled, sealed jars upright into the boiling water-bath. When all the jars are in place, the water should be 1 to 2 inches above the top of the jar. Add water as needed. Bring the water to a low boil before starting the timer for processing.

                At the end of processing, turn off the heat and let the jars sit in the water bath until the boiling has stopped. This will reduce siphoning -- when the food burbles up under the lid, breaking the seal. Use the jar lifter or tongs to transfer the jars to a folded towel, placed upright. Leave the jars until they have completely cooled, at least 12 hours. Remove the rings and test the seal by lifting the jar by the lid. The lid should hold fast. Label and store in a cool, dry, dark space.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select those with uniformly green color, compact globes and tightly adhering leaves. Remove all leaves and choke or fuzzy portion. The portion that is left at the base is the heart. Cut away the stem just below the heart and trim any woody portions. Wash hearts in cold water and drain.

                Water blanch 7 minutes. Cook, drain and pack, leaving no head space. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>

            <name>Asparagus</name>
            <canningMethod>Quantity: An average of 24½ pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 16 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A crate weighs 31 pounds and yields 7 to 12 quarts--an average of 3½ pounds per quart.

                Quality: Use tender, tight-tipped spears, 4 to 6 inches long.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Wash asparagus and trim off tough scales. Break off tough stems and wash again. Cut into 1-inch pieces or can whole.

                Hot pack – Cover asparagus with boiling water. Boil 2 or 3 minutes. Loosely fill jars with hot asparagus, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Raw pack – Fill jars with raw asparagus, packing as tightly as possible without crushing, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jars, if desired. Add boiling water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process as recommended in Table 1 or Table 2 according to the method of canning used.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select young tender spears. Wash thoroughly and sort into sizes. Trim stalks by removing scales with a sharp knife. Cut into even lengths to fit containers.

                Water blanch small spears 2 minutes, medium spears 3 minutes and large spears 4 minutes.

                Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving no headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Wash the asparagus and cut off the tough ends.

                cut the stalks into one inch pieces

                Cut the stalks into one inch(ish) pieces. I wasn’t very exact about this.

                blanch for 3 minutes in a rolling water bath

                Blanch in a rolling hot water bath for 3 minutes. The timer is started from the time they are boiling, not when you put them in the water. After 3 minutes, place them into ice water to stop the cooking process.

                place the pieces on the dehydrator trays in a single layer

                Lay them out in single layers in your dehydrator. If you have the kind with adjustable trays, you may want to rotate them around after 6 hours or so. I moved the ones closest to the heat to the top and shuffled the rest around. This picture is after about 3 hours, you can see that the thinner pieces are shrinking up.

                12 hours later I have dehydrated asparagus, ready to go into my cupboards for storage. I’ve used my FoodSaver to take the oxygen out of the jars so they will stay fresh.

                TIP: If you sort your pieces onto trays by thickness, there will be less work. The thick ones take longer to dry, and at the end, I was picking finished pieces out of the trays.</dryingMethod>

            <name>Beans: Green, Snap, or Wax</name>
            <canningMethod>Quantity: An average of 14 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 9 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 30 pounds and yields 12 to 20 quarts – an average of 2 pounds per quart.

                Quality: Select filled but tender, crisp pods. Remove and discard diseased and rusty pods.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Wash beans and trim ends. Leave whole or cut or snap into 1-inch pieces.

                Hot pack –Cover with boiling water; boil 5 minutes. Fill jars loosely with beans, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 1 teaspoon of canning salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Cover beans with hot cooking liquid, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Raw pack – Fill jars tightly with raw beans, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 1 teaspoon of canning salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Add boiling water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process in a pressure canner following the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2 according to the type of canner being used. (There is no safe option for processing green beans in a boiling water canner.)</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select young tender pods when the seed is first formed. Wash in cold water, snip and cut into 2 to 4-inch lengths.

                Water blanch 3 minutes. Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>You can dry beans and peas in an oven if you don’t have a dehydrator. The best type of oven is an electric fan oven but a standard or a gas oven will do the job. Please note that beans dried in this manner are not suitable for sprouting as the blanching kills the germ.

                Pod your peas or beans and drop into cold water. The reason for this is you may well have a few pea maggots and they will float out in the water.

                Now blanch for about three minutes. Since they inevitably slip through the holes in a blanching basket, we just drop them straight into the blanching water and then use a fine sieve to fish them out.

                Don’t cool after blanching, just dry them on a towel before spreading onto trays and drying in the oven. The ideal is to dry at a temperature starting at 50°C/120°F/Gas Mark 0 and then increase the temperature slowly up to 65°C/150°F/Gas Mark 0.

                The beans and peas are dry when they are quite crisp. Depending on their size, this takes between 2-3 hours. Pack in tightly corked bottles or airtight containers and store in a dry, dark place.</dryingMethod>

            <name>Beans: Lima, Butter, or Pinto</name>
            <canningMethod>Beans or Peas - Shelled, Dried: All Varieties

                Quantity: An average of 5 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 3¼ pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints--an average of ¾ pounds per quart.

                Quality: Select mature, dry seeds. Sort out and discard discolored seeds.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Place dried beans or peas in a large pot and cover with water. Soak 12 to 18 hours in a cool place. Drain water. To quickly hydrate beans, you may cover sorted and washed beans with boiling water in a saucepan. Boil 2 minutes, remove from heat, soak 1 hour and drain. Cover beans soaked by either method with fresh water and boil 30 minutes. Add ½ teaspoon of salt per pint or 1 teaspoon per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with beans or peas and cooking water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process as recommended in Table 1 or Table 2 according to the method of canning used.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Harvest while the seed is in the green stage. Wash, shell and sort according to size.

                Water blanch small beans 2 minutes, medium beans 3 minutes and large beans 4 minutes. Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.

            <name>Beets</name>
            <canningMethod>Quantity: An average of 21 pounds (without tops) is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 13-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel (without tops) weighs 52 pounds and yields 15 to 20 quarts--an average of 3 pounds per quart.

                Quality: Beets with a diameter of 1 to 2 inches are preferred for whole packs. Beets larger than 3 inches in diameter are often fibrous.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Trim off beet tops, leaving an inch of stem and roots to reduce bleeding of color. Scrub well. Cover with boiling water. Boil until skins slip off easily; about 15 to 25 minutes depending on size. Cool just enough to handle without burning yourself, then remove skins, and trim off stems and roots. The beets should remain warm or hot going into the jars. Leave baby beets whole. Cut medium or large beets into 1/2-inch cubes or slices. Halve or quarter very large slices. Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with hot beets and fresh hot water that has been brought to a boil first (not the water you used to boil the beets with), leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2 according to the method of canning used.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select deep, uniformly-red, tender, young beets. Wash and sort according to size. Trim tops, leaving 1/2 inch of stems and tap root, to prevent bleeding of color during cooking.

                Cook in boiling water until tender-for small beets 25 to 30 minutes; for medium beets 45 to 50 minutes.

                Cool promptly in cold water. Peel, remove stem and tap root, and cut into slices or cubes. Package, leaving ½-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Dried beets usually are reconstituted or added to soups and stews. If properly dried, beets retain their flavor and much of their nutritional value.

                Blanch the beets in boiling water for 20 minutes and transfer them into a container of ice water. Scrape the peels from the beets.

                Trim off the stems and taproot and slice the beets into uniform, 1/8-inch-wide strips. Chop the beets into 1/4-inch-thick pieces or grate them using a box grater.

                Heat the food dehydrator to 120 degrees Fahrenheit and lay the beet pieces about 1/4 inch apaprt from each other on the drying trays.

                If using an oven, heat it to the Warm setting. Place the beets on cooling racks covered with a piece of cheesecloth.

                Dry beet strips until they are brittle or crisp, about 8 hours, in the dehydrator; dry chopped or grated beets for four to six hours.

                If using the oven, dry beet strips for 4 hours and shredded beets for 2 hours.

                THINGS YOU WILL NEED
                Knife
                Box grater (optional)
                Food dehydrator
                Cooling or baking rack (optional)
                Cheesecloth (optional)
                TIP
                Pack the dried and cooled beets into dry, airtight containers or plastic bags that seal. Store the dried beets in a cool, dark place. Check the beets after a few days and then periodically to make sure they are completely dried. Use dried beets within six to 12 months. Discard the beets and disinfect the containers if you see signs of mold or other spoilage. Soak dried beets in cold water for one hour to reconstitute. Add dry or reconstituted beets to soups or stews. Dried beets will double in size when reconstituted.</dryingMethod>

            <name>Broccoli</name>
            <canningMethod>Spicy Quick Pickled Broccoli

                Ingredients
                1 pound fresh broccoli
                sprinkling of sea salt
                3/4 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
                3 tablespoons sesame oil
                1 1/2 teaspoons chili paste
                1 teaspoon garlic, minced
                1 teaspoon granulated sugar
                Instructions
                Fill a large bowl with ice water and set aside.
                Cut the broccoli into uniform spears.  Rinse, drain, add them to a large bowl. Set aside.

                Place a steamer rack into a pot with the water level just below it.  Over high heat, bring the water to a boil and then add the broccoli to the rack, sprinkle it with salt and cover.  Turn the heat to low and steam just until the broccoli is tender, 4 to 5 minutes.

                Drain the broccoli and immediately add it to the bowl of ice water. Leave it for about 5 minutes, drain again, pat dry with a kitchen towel, and set aside. (The ice water "shocks" the broccoli, which stops the cooking process and helps keep the color bright.)

                In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk the vinegar with the sesame oil, chili paste, garlic, and sugar. Pour this mixture into a heavy-duty zip-lock bag and add the broccoli. Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible and place it in a bowl (in case it leaks), in the refrigerator.
                Let the broccoli marinate for about 1 hour, drain and serve.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select firm, young, tender stalks with compact heads. Remove leaves and woody portions. Separate heads into convenient-size sections and immerse in brine (4 teaspoons salt to 1 gallon water) for 30 minutes to remove insects. Split lengthwise so flowerets are no more than 1 1/2 inches across.

                Water blanch 3 minutes in boiling water or steam blanch 5 minutes.

                Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving no headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Harvest your broccoli fresh from the garden or get it fresh from the farmer’s market.

                On the same day you bring it in, wash it under cold running water.

                Put it in a sink of cold water to which you’ve added 1 tbsp. of Himalayan salt.  Allow it to soak for 1 hour.  This is to remove any of the squeamy, green broccoli worms.  Don’t skip this step with organic broccoli, even store bought.
                Drain it.

                Cut the flower from the stems and chop them finely, about the size you’d want to use in soups or stews.

                Shred the stems with a box grater.

                Put the flowers on a dehydrator tray in a single layer.

                Put the shredded stems on another dehydrator tray in a thin layer.

                Put all the trays in your dehydrator and process on medium heat over night.

                In the morning, shuffle the trays so that the front of the trays is at the back of the dehydrator, and the top trays are shuffled to the bottom.

                Allow to dry for another 4 to 6 hours or until dry, and brittle.

                Turn off the dehydrator and allow the contents to cool naturally.

                Check for doneness.  When done your vegetables should be dry and brittle.  There should be no coldness when you touch them.  If there is any coolness at all, process them for another 2 hours and test again for doneness.  Coolness is an indication of internal moisture.

                Once your dried vegetables are completely done and cooled, store in glass jars with tight fitting lids.  Don’t trust a snap lid with a canning ring.  Bugs have been known to infiltrate jars through the gap at the top of the canning ring.

                The plastic lids that they sell for dry storage in canning jars is a better choice to keep bugs out.</dryingMethod>

            <canningMethod>Zesty Pickled Brussels Sprouts

                Ingredients:
                2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half
                5 1-pint canning jars with lids and rings
                5 cloves garlic, divided
                1 1/4 teaspoons red pepper flakes, divided
                5 cups water
                5 cups distilled white vinegar
                7 tablespoons pickling salt

                Directions:
                Soak Brussels sprouts in a large bowl filled with lightly salted water for about 15 minutes. Drain well.

                Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes.

                Divide the drained Brussels sprouts evenly between jars, filling the jars about 3/4-inch from the top.

                Place 1 garlic clove and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes in each jar.

                Bring vinegar, water, and pickling salt to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat until the salt is dissolved, about 5 minutes.

                Pour the vinegar mixture into the jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top.

                Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles.

                Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.

                Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot, and fill stockpot halfway with water.

                Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary, until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.

                Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool.

                Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 3 weeks before opening.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select green, firm and compact heads. Examine heads carefully to make sure they are free from insects. Trim, removing coarse outer leaves. Wash thoroughly. Sort into small, medium and large sizes.

                Water blanch small heads 3 minutes, medium heads 4 minutes and large heads 5 minutes. Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving no headspace. Seal and freeze.

            </freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>1. Selection &amp; Ingredients

                Select vegetables at peak quality and flavor. Do not use vegetables that show signs of decay, mold, or bruising. These defects may affect all pieces being dried.
                Ice is needed for cooling the Brussels sprouts following blanching
                Citric acid (optional)-1 teaspoon (4 grams) in a gallon of water for blanching step as an anti-microbial agent

                2. Equipment

                Clean, food-grade dehydrator or oven with drying trays or racks that allow for good air circulation.
                Many types of food dehydrators can be used and are explained in detail in Food Dehydrators.
                Conditioning containers
                Large, clean plastic or glass container with lid
                Storage containers
                Clean, dry home canning jars, plastic freezer containers with tight-fitting lids or plastic freezer bags
                Vacuum packaging is also a good storage option
                Large covered cooking pot (for blanching)
                Metal blanching basket, cheesecloth or mesh bag (for blanching vegetables prior to drying)
                Colander, slotted spoon or strainer
                Large bowl (for cooling blanched vegetables in ice water)
                Hot pads
                Cutting board
                Knife
                Timer or clock

                3. Prepare Ingredients

                Pre-treating vegetables by blanching is recommended to enhance quality and safety. Blanching improves color and texture, relaxes tissues so pieces dry faster, reduces the time needed to rehydrate vegetables, and helps to destroy potentially harmful bacteria.

                Thoroughly wash Brussels sprouts.
                Cut in half lengthwise through the stem.
                Fill large cooking pot with 1 gallon of water and bring to a rolling boil.
                If desired, add 1 teaspoon (4 grams) citric acid to the water as an anti-microbial agent.
                Put no more than four cups of the vegetable pieces in a blanching basket, or a piece of cheesecloth or cloth mesh bag with ends secured.
                Lower vegetable bag into boiling water, making sure water covers the vegetables. Shake bag so hot water reaches all pieces, if necessary.
                Blanch for time shown in table below for your elevation:
                Blanching Time for Drying
                Below 5,000 ft.	5,000 ft. and above
                4 1/2- 5 1/2 minutes	5 1/2- 6 1/2 minutes


                Start timing as soon as water returns to a boil.
                Montior heat to ensure continuous boiling.
                Remove vegetables from boiling water and submerge briefly in a large bowl of ice, only long enough to stop the cooking action.
                NOTE: Do not cool to room temperature.
                Drain on paper towel or cloth.
                Repeat process until entire batch is blanched and cooled.

                4. Dry

                Arrange blanched Brussels sprouts in single layers on drying trays.
                Dry at 140 degrees F (60°C) in an oven or dehydrator.
                If necessary, turn large pieces over every 3 to 4 hours during the drying period.
                Vegetables can scorch easily toward the end of drying, so monitor more closely as drying nears completion.
                Dried Brussels sprouts should be tough to brittle.
                Total Drying Time: 12-18 hours in a dehydrator (may take up to twice as long in a conventional oven)

                5. Condition

                Condition Brussels sprouts by placing cooled, dried vegetables loosely in large plastic or glass containers, about two-thirds full.
                Lightly cover and store in a dry, well-ventilated place for 4 to 10 days.
                Stir or shake containers daily to separate pieces.
                NOTE: If beads of moisture form inside the container return Brussels sprouts to drying trays for further drying, then repeat the conditioning step.

                6. Store

                Store small amounts of cooled, conditioned dried vegetables in moisture-vapor-proof containers or bags.
                Label packages with name of product, date and method of pretreatment and drying.
                Store in a cool, dry, dark place or in the refrigerator or freezer.
                Properly stored, dried vegetables keep well for six to 12 months.
                Discard foods that have off odors or show signs of mold.

                7. Using Dried Vegetables

                Dried vegetables can be eaten ‘as is’ as a snack or part of a meal.
                Adding dried vegetables directly to soups and stews is the simplest way to rehydrate vegetables.</dryingMethod>

            <name>Cabbage or Chinese Cabbage</name>
            <canningMethod>Sauerkraut
                Ingredients:

                5 lbs cabbage (5 lbs)
                3 tablespoons pickling salt

                Instructions:
                Take cabbage, discard outer leaves.

                Wash heads under running water, shake excess water off.

                With a large knife such as a French knife, quarter the cabbage heads.
                Cut out and discard the cores.

                Slice the quartered cabbage into slices about 2 mm (.07 inches) thick (the thickness of a US / Cdn quarter or a 10 p piece.)

                Put cabbage either into a very large bowl or directly into the container you are going to use to ferment it in - whatever you prefer to be working in.

                Sprinkle the salt over and mix in.

                Some sources say to let it stand a bit so the salt will start drawing at least a bit of liquid out. Some suggest 10 minutes; the All New Ball says cover it and let stand for an hour.

                Begin pounding / crushing the cabbage, and keep on crushing it until a good amount of liquid has been released from the leaves.

                Ideally, you are going to be aiming for enough released liquid to cover the cabbage once in the fermenting container, but you may rarely get it at this point -- don't worry.

                Add to fermenting container, if it's not already.

                If you are doubling, tripling or quadrupling the recipe, start the next batch of cabbage now, then add to container.

                Repeat until you have prepped all the cabbage you planned to.

                When you are finished crushing, if the cabbage is not already in the fermentation container, move it all there.

                Be sure to leave a gap of 10 to 12 cm (4 to 5 inches) between the cabbage in the container, and the top rim of the container as headspace.

                If you have more cabbage than that, you'll need another container.

                If the juice you were able to produce was not sufficient to cover the cabbage, then make a brine (see directions below) and use that to top up with. (To be clear: you are not aiming to fill the container to the top rim with liquid; you are after enough liquid to completely submerge all the cabbage by 2 to 5 cm / 1 to 2 inches.) FIRST, though, see Linda Ziedrich suggestion in Brine section: she suggests waiting 24 hours to see if it will produce enough juice on its own before adding the extra brine.

                Cover cabbage with some sort of weight (see Weights Options below) to keep it safely below the surface of the liquid.

                Cover container with a large towel.

                Let ferment for 3 to 4 weeks or until cabbage is translucent.

                During fermentation, you may or may not need to check the cabbage frequently. It depends on the weights you use (see Weights Options below).</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Frozen cabbage or Chinese cabbage are suitable for use only as a cooked vegetable.

                Select freshly picked, solid heads. Trim coarse outer leaves from head. Cut into medium to coarse shreds or thin wedges, or separate head into leaves. Water blanch 1½ minutes.

                Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving ½-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.

            </freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Preparation
                Prepping this great vegetable for dehydrating is fairly simple:

                Remove the outer leaves from each head of cabbage.
                Stem and core the larger cabbage varieties. Those parts don’t dehydrate or reconstitute that well.
                Clean and wash, then let stand or pat dry.
                Cut or process the head into quarters, and then into thin strips approximately 1/8” wide. Length can vary with no problem.
                Remember, there is no need to blanch the cabbage prior to dehydrating.

                Dehydrating

                Arrange the the slices onto your dehydrator trays. They can nestle close together, even overlap just a touch.
                Turn on your dehydrator to the recommended temperature. Usually between 125 degrees and 135 degrees Fahrenheit.
                Dry between 8 – 11 hours depending on the thickness of the cabbage leaves. Don’t forget to rotate your dehydrator trays for even drying.
                After your cabbage pieces are fully dry, I suggest letting the cabbage stand at room temp for a night before packaging them for storage.

                Storing dehydrated cabbage

                There are a wide variety of choices as far as storage containers. For me, it depends on what my goals are. If it is long term storage, then I use everything from canning jars to mylar bags. I make sure to add some type of oxygen absorbers in each container. I don’t suggest using plastic containers of any kind. I have had leakage problems no matter how carefully I store and stack them.</dryingMethod>

            <name>Carrots</name>
            <canningMethod>Sliced or Diced
                Quantity: An average of 17-1/2 pounds (without tops) is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 11 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel (without tops) weighs 50 pounds and yields 17 to 25 quarts – an average of 2-1/2 pounds per quart.

                Quality: Select small carrots, preferably 1 to 1-1/4 inches in diameter. Larger carrots are often too fibrous.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Wash, peel, and rewash carrots. Slice or dice.

                Hot pack – Cover with boiling water; bring to boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Fill jars, leaving 1-inch of headspace.

                Raw pack – Fill jars tightly with raw carrots, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Add hot cooking liquid or water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2 according to the method of canning used.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select young, tender, coreless, medium length carrots. Remove tops, wash and peel. Leave small carrots whole. Cut others into thin slices, 1/4-inch cubes or lengthwise strips.

                Water blanch small whole carrots 5 minutes, diced or sliced 2 minutes and lengthwise strips 2 minutes.

                Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Wash and scrub carrots in cold water. Cut the tops off. Chop into small chunks... about 1/4 inch or so.

                I have tried chopping the carrots up in a food processor. It is faster, but the carrots will end up being much smaller pieces. Almost too small.

                It works.... but by the time they are dried, the carrots are extremely small.

                When they get this small they will tend to fall through even a screen in a dehydrator. I prefer to use a knife and make my pieces a bit larger.

                Use a mandolin slicer to make nice thin slices, then just coarsely chop these slices. You could also just do it all with a good sharp knife.

                Blanch carrots for 3 to 4 minutes. This will help the carrots to dehydrate quicker. It releases some of the juices and stops enzyme actions.

                To blanch simply plunge in boiling water using a blancher makes this easy. Start counting time as soon as you dunk the carrots.

                Then plunge them into cold or even ice water. This cools the carrots and stops the cooking process. Use a strainer and then let the carrots drain well before spreading them for the dehydrator.

                Drain well and spread in a single layer on a dehydrator tray. Be sure the carrots are spread enough that air flows freely around them.

                Dry at 125 degrees until dry and crispy. Check every so often (every couple of hours) and stir them around, rotate trays if needed. This will encourage them to dry evenly.

                Dehydrated carrots are done when they are crispy dry. Store in an airtight container. Turn your container over on the counter for a day or two and check for moisture building up in the jar. If you notice any wetness..... they are not dry enough. Return them to the dehydrator.</dryingMethod>

            <canningMethod>https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/pickled-cauliflower-recipe.htm</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Choose compact white heads. Trim off leaves and cut head into pieces about 1 inch across. If necessary to remove insects, soak for 30 minutes in solution of salt and water (4 teaspoons salt per gallon water). Drain.

                Water blanch for 3 minutes in water containing 4 teaspoons salt per gallon water.

                Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving no headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>What you’ll need:

                1 medium head cauliflower
                1 teaspoon turmeric powder
                1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste

                Method:

                1. Remove the outer leaves and stalk from the cauliflower head. Cut into florets.
                2. Place the cauliflower florets in a food processor. Pulse until you get the texture of rice or couscous.

                3. Cook in your favorite way: by frying, microwaving or roasting. I prefer roasting. It gives to cauliflower rice light, fluffy texture and pleasant nutty flavor.

                Preheat oven to 400F/200C.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour the riced cauliflower onto prepared baking sheet.
                Sprinkle with turmeric and season to taste. Mix well and then spread out evenly. Roast for about 15 minutes, mixing once or twice during cooking. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.

                4. Spread the cauliflower rice on dehydrator trays covered with non-stick sheets or parchment paper.

                5. Cover with mash sheet to prevent scattering of small dried cauliflower rice pieces throughout the dehydrator.

                6. Dehydrate at 135F/57C for about 4-8 hours until completely dry and crunchy.

                7. Let cool, then pack into airtight container or zip-lock bag. Store in dry, dark and cool place.

                Rehydration:

                Dehydrated cauliflower rice rehydrates very quickly. Just mix it with equal quantity of hot water, stir well, and let sit in a cozy for 5 to 10 minutes. If you’ll mix it with other ingredients such as meat or vegetables, rehydration may take a bit longer.

            <name>Celery</name>
            <canningMethod>The USDA never backed canning plain celery or had developed directions for it. Also see https://www.healthycanning.com/canning-celery/</canningMethod>

            <freezingMethod>Celery loses its crispness when frozen. The frozen product is suitable only for cooked dishes.

                Preparation – Select crisp, tender stalks, free from coarse strings. Wash thoroughly, trim and cut stalks into l-inch lengths.

                Water blanch for 3 minutes. Cool promptly, drain and package leaving no headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>What You Need
                Celery
                Dehydrator or oven
                Large pot
                Water
                Stove
                Storage jar

                How to Prepare Celery for Dehydrating
                Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
                While it is heating, wash the celery. Cut off the whitish bottom ends and the leafy top ends. Save the ends and leaves for soup stock by freezing them. If you keep adding them to a container in the freezer, you will never have to buy celery just to make stock.
                Cut the celery stalks into thirds. Dump them into the boiling water, and leave for 1 minute. Drain them, and immediately run them under cold water or immerse in ice water to stop the residual heat from continuing to cook the celery.
                Slice the blanched celery into 1/2-inch-thick crescents. At this point, you can stop and store the blanched, sliced celery in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before proceeding with the dehydration.

                Dehydrator Method
                Arrange the celery pieces on the trays of a dehydrator, leaving 1/4-inch space on all sides between the pieces. If you are using an oven rather than a dehydrator, arrange the pieces on a screen placed over a baking rack.
                Dry at 135 F until the celery is crispy-dry. This usually takes 6 to 8 hours.

                Oven Method
                If you are using an oven that doesn't have a temperature setting below 150 F (many don't), set it to the lowest heat, and prop the oven door open with a dish towel or wooden spoon. Note that this wastes a lot of energy. If you are planning to dry a lot of food, a dehydrator is a worthwhile investment both financially and environmentally.
                When the celery is crispy-dry (usually takes 6 to 8 hours), remove the trays or baking sheet(s), and let them cool at room temperature for 10 minutes.

            <name>Corn</name>
            <canningMethod>Quantity: An average of 31½ pounds (in husk) of sweet corn is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 20 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 35 pounds and yields 6 to 11 quarts – an average of 4½ pounds per quart.

                Quality: Select ears containing slightly immature kernels or of ideal quality for eating fresh. Canning of some sweeter varieties or too immature kernels may cause browning. Can a small amount, check color and flavor before canning large quantities.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Husk corn, remove silk, and wash. Blanch 3 minutes in boiling water. Cut corn from cob at about three-fourths the depth of kernel. Caution: Do not scrape cob.

                Hot pack – To each clean quart of kernels in a saucepan, add 1 cup of hot water, heat to boiling and simmer 5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with corn and cooking liquid, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Raw pack – Fill jars with raw kernels, leaving 1-inch headspace. Do not shake or press down. Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jar, if desired.

                Add fresh boiling water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2 according the the method of canning used.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select only tender, freshly-gathered corn in the milk stage. Husk and trim the ears, remove silks and wash.

                Corn-on-the-cob – Water blanch small ears (1¼ inches or less in diameter) 7 minutes, medium ears (1¼ to 1½ inches in diameter) 9 minutes and large ears (over 1½ inches in diameter) 11 minutes. Cool promptly and completely to prevent a "cobby" taste. Drain and package. Seal and freeze.

                Whole Kernel Corn – Water blanch 4 minutes. Cool promptly, drain and cut from cob. Cut kernels from cob about 2/3 the depth of the kernels. Package, leaving ½-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.

                Cream Style Corn – Water blanch 4 minutes. Cool promptly and drain. Cut kernel tips and scrape the cobs with the back of a knife to remove the juice and the heart of the kernel. Package, leaving ½-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.

                Another way to prepare cream style corn for freezing is to cut and scrape the corn from the cob without blanching. Place the cut corn in a double boiler, and heat with constant stirring for about 10 minutes or until it thickens; allow to cool by placing the pan in ice water. Package in moisture-vapor resistant containers, leaving ½-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.

            </freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Step 1
                Husk the corn. If you can, do this outside.

                Step 2
                Blanch corn by bringing bring a large pot of water to boil. Once boiling add cobs of corn to water, wait for water to return to boiling then boil for 4 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately cool in an ice water bath and drain well. Blanching ensures the aging enzymes in corn (the ones that turn corn from sweet to starchy) are destroyed and keeps your corn tasty sweet and delicious.

                Do NOT add salt to water as this will toughen the corn.

                Step 3
                Cut corn off the cobs by placing cob end in the opening of a bundt pan. The pan will catch all the kernels and provide a steady base for the cob of corn as you run a sharp knife down the sides of the cob between the cob and the corn kernels.

                Alternatively, cut a slice off the bottom of the corn cob to give you a level surface so you can hold the cob vertically on a cutting board without it wobbling. Run the knife down the sides of the cob.

                Step 4
                Spread corn kernels on dehydrator trays in a single layer to allow for plenty of air circulation. Break any large pieces of corn apart into separate kernels for even drying.

                Step 5
                Dehydrate at 125°F or 52°C until corn kernels are hard and dry. Most vegetables like corn should be dried so they are brittle enough that they would shatter if hit with a hammer. Depending on humidity levels this can take 8-12 hours.

                Step 6
                Allow corn to cool thoroughly before storing in airtight jars.  Simply turn the dehydrator off and let them sit for another 60 minutes.  This ensures that there won’t be any condensation build up on the inside of the jars.

                Step 7
                Store in airtight containers in a cool, dry, dark place for up to one year.

            <name>Cucumbers</name>
            <canningMethod>Pickles

                Ingredients

                Ingredients for Canned Cucumbers:
                6 bay leaves (1 per jar)
                1/2 Tbsp peppercorn (5 per jar)
                6 Dill Stems with Flowers cut into 3" pieces (1 full stem per jar)
                12 garlic cloves halved (2 cloves per jar)
                2 inch horseradish root chopped and divided, optional but nice
                6 lbs small cucumbers well rinsed with ends trimmed

                Ingredients for Pickling Brine:
                8 cups water
                1/3 cup granulated sugar
                6 Tbsp pickling salt (or 1/3 cup)
                6 cups distilled white Vinegar (5% acidity)

                Tools Needed for Canning:
                6 Quart-sized wide-mouth mason jars with rings and new lids
                1 large Stock Pot (20Qt+) with Rack (or a canner)
                1 jar lifter to safely transfer the jars

                Instructions

                How to Sterilize Canning Jars and Lids:
                Wash jars and lids with soap and water.
                Place jars and lids in a pot of water, bring to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer 10 minutes. Drain the water carefully then your jars and lids are ready to use.

                How to Make Homemade Pickles:

                Divide bay leaves, peppercorns, dill stems, garlic and horseradish (optional) into the bottoms of 6 Quart-sized jars. Pack cucumbers tightly into jars.

                In a medium pot, combine 8 cups water, 1/3 cup sugar, 6 Tbsp salt and 6 cups vinegar. Bring pickling juice to a boil then pour over cucumbers leaving 1/2” of space at the top. Screw the lids on enough to keep a tight seal in place but don't over-tighten them since air bubbles need to be able to escape.

                Place jars in a canner or large pot lined with a wire rack at the bottom. Once all of the jars are in the pot, add boiling hot water, to cover jars with 1-2 inches of water. Process/boil for 15 minutes.

                Carefully remove jars from the water using a jar lifter and leave at room temperature undisturbed for 12-24 hours. You may hear a pop when the jars fully seal. After 24 hours, check that the seal has formed by pushing down on the center of the lid - it should not move at all. If the seal does not form, refrigerate pickles and enjoy within 3 months.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>One way to freeze cucumbers is to slice them and put the cucumber slices on a baking the sheet lined with parchment paper. Pop the baking sheet into the freezer for a few hours. Put the frozen cucumber slices in a ziplock bag. Label the bag and put it back into the freezer.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Spice Mixes:
                Spicy:
                These are great just eaten from a bowl, or tossed onto soups. They make a great compliment to cream soups like cream of mushroom, or cream of chicken. Toss 1/2 pound of sliced cucumbers in:
                1/4 tsp salt
                1 tsp chili powder
                1 tsp paprika
                Herb:
                These are wonderful served alongside light meals like vegetable soups or grilled chicken or fish. Feel free to substitute your favorite herbs, such as dill and parsley, or basil and oregano.
                1/4 tsp salt
                1/4 tsp pepper (optional)
                1 tsp dried thyme
                1 tsp dried rosemary
                Sweet:
                The lightness of cucumbers lends itself to a sweet flavor mix. These make nice snacks, and I think they’d be a great addition sprinkled over spicier dishes as a way to offset the heat, like a spicy goulash or bowl of hot chili:
                1/2 tsp sugar
                1 tsp cocoa powder
                1 tsp cinnamon

                Instructions:

                For all of the flavor combinations, I dried enough cucumbers for one or two servings (1/2 a pound of cucumber); feel free to adjust the recipes to make more. The process is the same:


                1. Slice the cucumbers thin with either a sharp knife or a food mandolin. I sliced mine with a sharp knife to about 1/8 of an inch thick.

                2. Toss your sliced cucumbers in your spice mix.

                3. Place your sliced, spiced cucumbers in a single layer in your food dehydrator or (like I did) on a rack placed over a cookie sheet. Cucumbers seem to stick more than other foods I’ve dried, so make sure you oil the rack lightly.

                4. Dry for several hours in the oven at 170F (or the lowest setting of your oven), or however long your food dehydrator takes to dry foods.

                5. Eat as chips, or save to sprinkle over savory stews, salads, or toss into soups.</dryingMethod>

            <name>Eggplant</name>
            <canningMethod>INGREDIENT LIST FOR CANNED EGGPLANTS IN VINEGAR WITH CHILLI
                8 mini purple eggplants
                Salt
                1 clove of garlic
                1 cup (25cl) of white vinegar
                3 cups (75cl) of water
                Good quality olive oil
                1 bird pepper, whole or ground
                Oregano

                DIRECTIONS
                1. Wash the small eggplants and cut them into strips. Here I kept the slices attached by the stem. You can do the same with larger eggplants, but you’ll have to peel them.

                2. Eggplant is best when the bitter juice is drawn out before canning. Put eggplants in a colander and sprinkle with a good amount of salt. Allow the eggplant to drain for 1h, up to 1h30. For larger specimens, wait for 3h.

                3. Once this time has elapsed, rinse eggplants stripes and press them between your hands several times to drain as much water as possible.

                4. Bring water and vinegar to a boil in a saucepan and then soak eggplant for 2-3 minutes.

                5. Collect eggplant using a slotted spoon. Mix or layer your ingredients in the sterilized canning jar. Place them with a few pieces of peeled garlic, oregano, and a little bit of ground or minced pepper between each layers of eggplant. Press to pack it well, then cover with olive oil. Add a ladle of the boiled water/vinegar mix (or a tablespoon, depending on the size of the jar).

                6. Close the lid tightly and store in a cool, dark place for at least one week. The longer it sits, the better. Enjoy on fresh bread!

                Tips:
                Regarding the water/vinegar mix, the 3/1 ratio is approximative and works well for small eggplants. Too much vinegar will alter the taste. But if you want to use bigger eggplants, just make sure to respect the principle of 2 parts water for 1 part vinegar (2/1 ratio).</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Harvest before seeds become mature and when color is uniformly dark. Wash, peel and slice 1/3-inch thick. Prepare quickly, enough eggplant for one blanching at a time.

                Water blanch 4 minutes in 1 gallon of boiling water containing 1/2 cup lemon juice. Cool, drain and package, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.

                For Frying – Pack the drained slices with freezer wrap between slices. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Step One: Slice or Dice Your Eggplants, One at a Time
                Select firm, fresh eggplants, as they will preserve better than ones that are already wrinkled or deteriorating.
                Prepare only one eggplant at a time, as the flesh discolors extremely fast.
                I have chosen to dice mine. You may slice them, or cut them into any shape you please. You may peel your eggplants, if you wish.

                Step Two: Blanch Your Eggplant Pieces
                You may steam blanch your eggplant pieces 3 minutes, or boil them 1 minute. Add citric acid or Fruit Fresh to the water, to help the eggplants hold their color. Blanching is supposed to help vegetables keep better once frozen or dried.
                Immediately put the eggplant pieces in ice-cold water (called "shocking"), to stop the cooking. I usually use a sinkful of water, but a bowl works, too.
                After a few batches, the water will discolor. That's alright. Add ice cubes with each batch, or pour off the water and get fresh.

                Step Three: Dry Your Eggplant Pieces
                I use a commercial dehydrator to dry many of my foods. I have never tried sun-drying eggplant. Scoop each batch onto the screen then spread around as evenly as you can.
                You don't need much room between pieces (they will shrink a lot, you know), but make sure you don't have any "clumps" of stuck-together pieces. Set dehydrator temperature to 140* F., and dry until quite hard.

                Step Four: Remove from Screens or Trays, and Package in Bags or Jars
                After most of the pieces are dry, pick out any that aren't, to dry some more. Tip remaining pieces to the center of the screen and place in an airtight bag or glass jar. In this bag are about three large eggplants.
                Jars are usually better than bags for keeping dried food in. If there is a pinhole leak, or you don't get the bag sealed 100%, that means your food is steadily deteriorating.</dryingMethod>

            <canningMethod>Ingredients
                Garlic heads broken apart and cloves peeled
                Distilled vinegar
                Large pot for boiling the vinegar
                Jars for storing the garlic

                Instructions
                Break apart your heads of garlic and peel the cloves. Place the peeled cloves of garlic in a large mixing bowl and fill with water. Use your fingertips to scrub any dirt off of the cloves. Once the cloves are cleaned, transfer them to a large strainer and rinse well.
                Depending on when your garlic was harvested, you might have very few brown spots on the cloves. My garlic was harvested late this year, so the ends were quite brown with some spots on the cloves as well. Use a small paring knife to trim the spots and then transfer the cleaned and trimmed cloves back to the strainer. Rinse again.
                Bring the vinegar to a boil in a large pot. For several hundred cloves of garlic, I used about 8 cups of vinegar. Place the clean garlic cloves into small jars. (I prefer to use small vs large jars to avoid contaminating a huge amount if the jar is open for too long in the refrigerator.) I filled 10 half pint jars with garlic. Once the vinegar has boiled, pour it over the garlic and screw the lids on tight.
                Let the jars come to room temperature on the counter overnight and then store in the refrigerator. This will keep in the refrigerator for up to a year. Enjoy!</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Research performed by the National Center for Home Food Preservation confirmed that mixtures of garlic in oil stored at room temperature are at risk for the development of botulism.

                Garlic-in-oil should be made fresh and stored in the refrigerator at 40°F or lower for no more than 4 days. It may be frozen for long term storage for up to several months. Package in glass freezer jars or plastic freezer boxes, leaving ½-inch headspace. Label, date and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Drying garlic is an easy and safe way to keep garlic indefinitely. Choose fresh, firm, flavourful cloves with no bruises and follow these simple directions.

                Peel the garlic cloves.
                Slice the garlic thinly. A food processor works well.
                Dry the garlic until crisp. In a dehydrator you have a choice of faster, hotter drying or slower, cooler drying. We dry our garlic for two days at about 45°C (115°F).
                Store the garlic. Dried garlic may be stored at room temperature in an airtight container. If you store the dried garlic in the freezer in the form of flakes, and then grind it close to the time when you will be using the garlic it will keep its amazing freshness for more than a year.
                Grind the garlic. A blender gives you a mixture of powder and granules which you can separate using a fine and a coarse seive. A coffee grinder not used for coffee is good for turning garlic flakes into powder.</dryingMethod>

            <name>Greens (including Spinach)</name>
            <canningMethod>Quantity: An average of 28 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 18 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 18 pounds and yields 3 to 9 quarts – an average of 4 pounds per quart.

                Quality: Can only freshly harvested greens. Discard any wilted, discolored, diseased, or insect- damaged leaves. Leaves should be tender and attractive in color.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Wash only small amounts of greens at one time. Drain water and continue rinsing until water is clear and free of grit. Cut out tough stems and midribs. Place 1 pound of greens at a time in cheesecloth bag or blancher basket and steam 3 to 5 minutes or until well wilted. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to each quart jar, if desired. Fill jars loosely with greens and add fresh boiling water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 and Table 2.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select young, tender green leaves. Wash thoroughly and cut off woody stems. Water blanch collards 3 minutes and all other greens 2 minutes.

                Cool, drain and package, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.

            </freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>To dehydrate the greens, place them in single layers on the dehydrator trays. Depending on your dehydrator model, (and whether or not it has a fan), the greens will dry in 8-24 hours at low to medium heat (115-125 F). Keep in mind that the lower the temperature, the longer the drying time.</dryingMethod>

            <canningMethod>Mint Jelly

                Ingredients

                1 1/2 cups of firmly packed mint leaves
                2 1/4 cups of water2 tblsp lemon juice
                3 1/2 cups of sugar (I use raw, unbleached sugar)
                Green food coloring (optional, the mint jelly is clear otherwise)
                1 pouch of liquid pectin
                4 8-ounce jelly jars (approx)

                Instructions

                The key…Freshness!!!  It is important to select the freshest produce when making any meal and even more so when working with herbs.  Although I keep a small herb garden handy on my back deck, I head to my garden in the morning to select fresh mint.

                After cutting, or purchasing, your mint be sure to clean and rise it with cold water in a colander being sure to remove any leaves that look ill in appearance. I purposely select only the finest leaves when canning. Using your thumb nail, pinch off each perfect lead you intend to use in the jelly and set aside.  Do not use the stem.  After measuring 1 1/2 cups of firmly packed mint leaves, chop finely.

                In a large saucepan, (I prefer stainless steel) combine mint and 2 1/4 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat, cover and let steep for 10 minutes.
                Place cheesecloth over your canning funnel or sieve and have a large glass dish ready to catch the liquid.  I use my 2 cup glass measuring cup so I can measure the liquid without having to dump the liquid a second time possibly losing precious liquid. Gently and slowly pour the mint water over the cheesecloth. Let your funnel/sieve sit over the glass dish until enough liquid has dripped giving you a full 1 3/4 cups.

                How to Dry Fresh Herbs

                Gather your clippings.

                Check in about two weeks to see how things are progressing. Keep checking weekly until your herbs are dry enough to crumble and ready to store.

                Remove any dry or diseased leaves from the cut herbs. Yellowed leaves and leaves spotted by disease are not worth drying. Their flavor has already been diminished by the stress of the season.

                Shake the branches gently to remove any insects. There are always hitchhikers, and since you won't be thoroughly washing the stems, get rid of as many as you can right now.

                Make sure the herbs are dry. If you've picked your herbs while the plants are dry, you should be able to simply shake off any excess soil. Rinse with cool water only if necessary and pat dry with paper towels. Hang or lay the herb branches out where they will get plenty of air circulation so they can dry out quickly. Wet herbs will mold and rot.

                Remove the lower leaves along the bottom inch or so of the stem. You can use these leaves fresh or dry them separately.

                Bundle four to six stems together and tie as a bunch. You can either use a string or a rubber band. The bundles will shrink as they dry and the rubber band will loosen, so check periodically to make sure that the bundle is not slipping. If you are trying to dry herbs that have a high water content, make small bundles so they get air flow between the branches and do not rot.

                Punch or cut holes in a paper bag, then label the bag with the name of the herb you are drying.

                Place the herb bundle upside down into the bag. You can include the loose leaves you removed from the bottom inch of the stems if you like.

                Secure the bag by gathering the end around the bundle and tie it closed. Make sure the herbs are not crowded inside the bag.

                Hang the bag upside down in a warm, airy room.

                How to Store Herbs
                Once you've completed the drying process:

                Store your dried herbs in airtight containers. Small canning jars work nicely. Zippered plastic bags will work, as well. Your herbs will retain more flavor if you store the leaves whole and crush them when you are ready to use them.

                Label and date your containers.

                Discard any dried herbs that show the slightest sign of mold. It will only spread.

                Place containers in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. There are now amber-colored canning jars that are designed to block sunlight.</dryingMethod>

            <name>Horseradish</name>
            <canningMethod>Ingredients
                1 cup grated horseradish
                1⁄2 cup white vinegar
                1/4 teaspoon sea salt or 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

                DIRECTIONS
                grated horseradish (trim skin with veggie peeler, wash and grind in a meat grinder or do in food processor) (I hear wearing goggles helps your eyes) Mix thoroughly with vinegar and salt using amounts as needed and pack into hot sterile jars.
                I usually process in a hot water bath for 10 min for pints.
                It is best to still store in the fridge, I think for colouring.
                If you want it creamy a client told me to put the whole mixture back into the food processor and puree a bit, I havent tried it yet but he said that is how the big companies do it.
                The heat all depends on the growing season and sometimes it gets hotter after stored.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Freezing is not recommended for whole pieces. However, grated fresh horseradish may be frozen up to 6 months. You may wish to flash-freeze it by the tablespoon in ice trays or on waxed paper, and then place in a sealed plastic bag in the freezer. Keep in mind that it will lose pungency when frozen.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Because jarred horseradish -- the kind that you usually see in the grocery store -- typically contains additives such as salt and vinegar, start with a fresh horseradish root for optimal results with pure horseradish flavor. Select a mature, firm root. Scrub the outside of the root with a vegetable brush and rinse the horseradish under running water. Trim the top from the root and slice it into 1/4-inch pieces or grate it using a box grater or a food processor.

                As a general rule, Deanna DeLong, author of _How to Dry Food_s, recommends drying horseradish at 150 degrees F for one hour, and then at 130 degrees F until the horseradish is dry and brittle. Some methods that you can use include:


                using a dehydrator, which is one of the easiest and most energy efficient ways to dry horseradish. Most dehydrators feature adjustable temperature controls and a built in fan to speed the process. Start the horseradish at 150 F, then lower the temperature to 130 F for another five to nine hours.

                oven-dehydrating horseradish, which requires no special equipment. If your oven doesn't go as low as 130 F, set it to the lowest possible setting and crack the door to maintain lower temperatures. Place a thermometer in the oven to monitor the heat. Arrange the horseradish on baking sheets lined with parchment paper and check it often for doneness, especially if you're drying it at a higher temperature, which takes less time.

                drying horseradish outside, which is best done on a dry, sunny day that's 85 F or warmer. Arrange the horseradish on a slatted tray or wire racks. Place it directly in the sun and allow it to dry in the sunlight, flipping the slices occasionally for even drying. Drying times vary widely depending on air circulation and humidity levels, but typically average four to 10 hours.</dryingMethod>

            <name>Mushrooms</name>
            <canningMethod>Mushrooms - Whole or Sliced
                Quantity: An average of 14-1/2 pounds is neeed per canner load of 9 pints; an average of 7-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 half-pints – an average of 2 pounds per pint.

                Quality: Select only brightly colored, small to medium-size domestic mushrooms with short stems, tight veils (unopened caps), and no discoloration. Caution: Do not can wild mushrooms.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Trim stems and discolored parts. Soak in cold water for 10 minutes to remove dirt. Wash in clean water. Leave small mushrooms whole; cut large ones. Cover with water in a saucepan and boil 5 minutes. Fill jars with hot mushrooms, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt per pint to the jar, if desired. For better color, add 1/8 teaspoon of ascorbic acid powder, or a 500-milligram tablet of vitamin C. Add fresh hot water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2 according to the method of canning used.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Choose mushrooms free from spots and decay. Sort according to size. Wash thoroughly in cold water. Trim off ends of stems. If mushrooms are larger than 1 inch across, slice them or cut them into quarters.

                Mushrooms can be steamed or heated in fat in a fry pan. Steamed mushrooms will keep longer than those heated in fat.

                To Steam – Mushrooms to be steamed have better color if given anti-darkening treatment first. To do this, dip for 5 minutes in a solution containing 1 teaspoon lemon juice or 11/2 teaspoons citric acid to a pint of water.

                Then steam whole mushrooms 5 minutes, buttons or quarters 31/2 minutes and slices 3 minutes. Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.

                To Heat in Fry Pan – Heat small quantities of mushrooms in margarine or butter in an open fry pan until almost done.

                Cool in air or set pan in which mushrooms were cooked in cold water. Pack into containers, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Ingredients
                Fresh shiitake mushrooms

                Instructions

                Start with fresh mushrooms (this method will not work with mushrooms past their prime), and wipe them clean with a lightly dampened towel. Do NOT wash them under running water.

                Transfer them to a container that allows air to circulate around them, such as a mesh colander, or a baking rack set on top of a baking sheet. Do not overcrowd the mushrooms.

                Place them in a well ventilated area (any area of the house with a ready supply of fresh air), preferably in the sun if possible. Allow them to air dry for 7-10 days, until they do not give when squeezed. Drying time will vary based on humidity levels and the size of the mushrooms.

                To expedite the process, you can partially dehydrate them in the oven before air drying. Place in an oven heated to 175 degrees F/80 degrees C for 2 hours, flipping them halfway through. Then transfer to a colander to air-dry for another 3-5 days.

                Store them in a sealed container for up to 2 years (be sure the mushrooms are COMPLETELY dried before sealing them away).

                Note: To rehydrate the mushrooms for cooking, soak in warm water for 1-2 hours. Use the soaking liquid in cooking if possible, as it is full of flavor.

                1 cup vinegar
                1/3 cup sugar
                3 1/2 tbsp kosher salt

                Pickle Ingredients
                2 lbs red onions
                1 3/4 tsp kosher salt
                1 1/2 tsp peppercorns
                3 bay leaves

                You will also need: 3 pint-sized 3 piece mason jars, wide mouth funnel, canning pot, round rack that will fit into the bottom of your canning pot, jar lifter, small saucepan, magnetic lid lift (optional), tongs, a few clean kitchen towels

                Instructions:
                Gluten Free Note: If you're making these pickles gluten free, make sure your vinegar is certified gluten free. If you can't find a GF white vinegar feel free to sub apple cider vinegar.

                To make brine: Combine water, vinegar, sugar and salt in a saucepot and simmer over low heat, stirring often, until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Set aside until ready to use.

                Trim the onions and slice into thin strips.

                Toss onions with 1 ¾ tsp kosher salt and allow to sit for about 30 minutes, then rinse.

                Evenly distribute the peppercorns and bay leaves between the pint jars.

                Add about 1/2 lb of sliced onions to each jar. Gently press down with tongs to make sure everything is loosely packed.

                Cover with brine, leaving about ½ inch of headspace. Make sure your brine is hot when you pour it over the onions.

                Let the jars return to room temperature, put the lids on, and store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. The longer they sit the more they’ll pickle.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Bulb onions store well in a cool, dry place. Freezing is usually not recommended for preserving whole onions, but see below if desired.

                Diced Onions – Peel, trim and clean thoroughly. Dice (about 1/4-inch pieces). No blanching is required. Either pack dry into recommended freezer bags or containers, leaving1/2-inch headspace.  Or, freeze separated pieces on a clean tray prior to packaging. Eliminate as much air as possible from the package for this method. Onions frozen this way are best used within a few months.

                Green Onions – Young green onions may be chopped for salads and cooking and frozen without blanching, but they will not be crisp. They will be highly flavored but may be slightly tough. They can be packaged by either of the methods above for diced onions.

                Whole Bulb Onions - Choose mature bulbs; peel, trim and clean thoroughly as for eating.
                Water blanch for 3 minutes (smaller onions) to 7 minutes (larger onions) or until center is completely heated.
                Cool promptly, drain well, and package, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Seal and freeze. These would be considered suitable for cooking only.

                Onion Rings – Wash, peel and slice onions. Separate slices into rings. Water blanch for 10 to 15 seconds. Cool promptly, drain and coat with flour. Dip in milk. Coat with a mixture of equal parts cornmeal and pancake mix. Arrange in a single layer on a tray. Freeze. Pack into containers using plastic wrap to separate the layers. No headspace is necessary. Seal and freeze.   To prepare, fry frozen rings in 375ºF oil until golden brown.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Helpful equipment for dehydrating onions:
                Food dehydrator
                Knife
                Cutting board
                Spice grinder
                Mesh strainer to separate onion flakes from onion powder
                Spice jars
                Gloves (optional to protect your hands from the strong onion fragrance)
                Kitchen goggles (optional to shield your eyes)

                Steps for Making Dehydrated Onions
                Any onion can be dehydrated, including red, white, and yellow. If you are cutting by hand, you may wish to wear gloves and eye protection to shield yourself from the pungent onion fragrance.

                Step 1: Prepare your onions
                Remove the onion skins, trim the ends, and slice into even sized pieces. I like to cut the onions in half, and then slice each half into 1/4-inch pieces. Sometimes, I use my food processor’s slicing blade to speed up the process.

                The onions can be in any shape, as long as they are all about the same size, so they will dry evenly. You can cut the onions into rings, chunks, or whatever is easiest. Just try to keep the pieces large enough so they don’t fall through the screens of your dehydrator.

                Tip: Save the onion trimmings in the freezer for homemade chicken stock.

                Step 2: Spread the onions out on the dehydrating screens
                Separate the onion segments and spread them out evenly on your dehydrator tray. The onion pieces can touch, but try not to overlap them, or they may not dehydrate evenly.

                Step 3: Dry your onions
                Dehydrate at 125˚F until completely dry, about 3 to 9 hours depending upon the size of your pieces and moisture content of your onions. It’s ok to stop the dehydrator and start it up again the next day. Follow the instructions for your dehydrator.

                Rotate your trays so the onions dry evenly. The dehydrated onions should be crisp and snap when your break them.

                Step 4: Package and store your dried onions
                Let the onions cool after dehydrating, crush them into onion flakes with your hands or a mallet, and then package into airtight glass containers.

                Label, date, and store the jars of dried onion flakes in a dark, cool area. Check the jars in a few days to be sure there isn’t any moisture accumulating on the glass.

                I fill small jars for my spice cabinet, and then store the rest of the dehydrated onions in mason jars in my basement food storage area. Properly dehydrated onions will not spoil, but the flavor does diminish over time.

            <canningMethod>Beans or Peas - Shelled, Dried: All Varieties
                Quantity: An average of 5 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 3¼ pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints--an average of ¾ pounds per quart.

                Quality: Select mature, dry seeds. Sort out and discard discolored seeds.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Place dried beans or peas in a large pot and cover with water. Soak 12 to 18 hours in a cool place. Drain water. To quickly hydrate beans, you may cover sorted and washed beans with boiling water in a saucepan. Boil 2 minutes, remove from heat, soak 1 hour and drain. Cover beans soaked by either method with fresh water and boil 30 minutes. Add ½ teaspoon of salt per pint or 1 teaspoon per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with beans or peas and cooking water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process as recommended in Table 1 or Table 2 according to the method of canning used.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select pods when seeds are tender and well-filled. Wash pods. Shell and discard over-mature and immature seeds and those injured by insects. Wash shelled peas.

                Water blanch 2 minutes. Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>
            <dryingMethod>Prepping Peas
                Before dehydrating, peas must be blanched in boiling water or steam to prevent enzymatic damage during storage. Before blanching, prepare an ice water bath to quickly cool the peas and stop the cooking process. Blanch snow peas in a steamer for 2 minutes, or for 1 minute in boiling water, and blanch sugar-snap peas in a steamer for 3 minutes or for 1 1/2 minutes in boiling water. Steam blanch shelled peas for 3 minutes or blanch them for 2 minutes in boiling water. Once the time is up, immediately immerse the peas in an ice bath until cool.

                Dehydrating Peas
                Place the peas on screens or trays in the dehydrator or oven. Set the temperature to 125 degrees Fahrenheit, or the lowest setting your oven allows, and dehydrate for 5 to 13 hours until the peas crisp and become brittle. In a dehydrator, stir the peas around after about 2 hours to allow for even drying. In an oven, it is necessary to stir the peas several times during drying to prevent uneven drying.

                Doneness Testing
                Shelling peas become wrinkly and hardened when completely dried. When firm pressure is applied to the peas, they should crumble. Sugar-snap and snow peas become brittle and darkened and take on a papery feel once completely dried. Sugar-snap peas become lumpy once dried, and you can confirm that they are done by cutting one pod open and checking that the peas inside the pod are dried.

                Rehydrating Peas
                To use dehydrated peas, they must be soaked first to rehydrate. Hot soak dried shelled peas for 30 minutes to 1 hour, or cold soak them overnight. Add the rehydrated peas to soups and stews where they can be cooked further, or simmer them in their cooking water to eat as a plain vegetable. Snow peas can be added to soups and stews in their dehydrated state if they will be cooked for more than 30 minutes, and sugar-snap peas can be added if they will cook longer than 45 minutes. To eat on their own, rehydrate sugar-snap or snow peas by covering them with boiling water for 15 to 45 minutes, or until they are no longer hard.</dryingMethod>

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure:

                Caution: Wear plastic or rubber gloves and do not touch your face while handling or cutting hot peppers. If you do not wear gloves, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your face or eyes.

                Select your favorite pepper(s). Small peppers may be left whole. Large peppers may be quartered. Remove cores and seeds. Slash two or four slits in each pepper, and either blanch in boiling water or blister using one of the following methods:

                Oven or broiler method: Place peppers in a hot oven (400° F) or broiler for 6-8 minutes until skins blister.

                Range-top method: Cover hot burner, either gas or electric, with heavy wire mesh. Place peppers on burner for several minutes until skins blister.

                Allow peppers to cool. Place in a pan and cover with a damp cloth. This will make peeling the peppers easier. After several minutes, peel each pepper. Flatten whole peppers. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to each pint jar, if desired. Fill jars loosely with peppers and add fresh boiled water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2 according to the method of canning used.</canningMethod>

            <name>Apples</name>
            <canningMethod>Quantity: An average of 19 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 12-1/4 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 48 pounds and yields 16 to 19 quarts-an average of 2-3/4 pounds per quart.
                Quality: Select apples that are juicy, crispy, and preferably both sweet and tart.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners and Using Boiling Water Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Wash, peel, and core apples. To prevent discoloration, slice apples into water containing ascorbic acid. Raw packs make poor quality products. Place drained slices in large saucepan and add 1 pint water or very light, light, or medium syrup per 5 pounds of sliced apples. Boil 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Fill jars with hot slices and hot syrup or water, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process.

                Processing directions for canning sliced apples in a boiling-water, a dial, or a weighted-gauge canner are given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. Tables at URl</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Syrup Pack is preferred for apples to be used for uncooked desserts or fruit cocktail. A sugar or dry pack is good for pie making.

                Select full-flavored apples that are crisp and firm, not mealy in texture. Wash, peel and core. Slice medium apples into twelfths, large ones into sixteenths.

                Syrup Pack – Use cold 40 percent syrup. To prevent browning, add 1/2 teaspoon (1500 mg) ascorbic acid to each quart of syrup.

                Slice apples directly into syrup in container starting with 1/2 cup syrup to a pint container. Press fruit down in containers and add enough syrup to cover. Leave headspace. Place a small piece of crumpled water-resistant paper on top to hold fruit down. Seal and freeze.

                Sugar Pack – To prevent darkening, dissolve 1/2 teaspoon (1500 mg) ascorbic acid in 3 tablespoons water. Sprinkle over the fruit. Or, apple slices can be steam blanched for 11/2 to 2 minutes.

                Mix 1/2 cup sugar with 1 quart (1 1/4 pounds) of fruit. Pack apples into containers and press fruit down, leaving headspace. Seal and freeze.

                Dry Pack – Follow the directions for Sugar Pack, omitting the sugar. Treated apple slices can also be frozen first on a tray and then packed into containers as soon as they are frozen. For more information, see other unsweetened packs.</freezingMethod>

            <canningMethod>Quantity: An average of 16 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 10 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 50 pounds and yields 20 to 25 quarts-an average of 2¼ pounds per quart.

                Quality: Select firm, well-colored mature fruit of ideal quality for eating fresh.

                Please read Using Pressure Canners and Using Boiling Water Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Wash fruit well if skins are not removed. (Optional procedure for removal of skins - Dip washed fruit in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds until skins loosen. Dip quickly in cold water and slip off skins.) Cut prepared apricots in half, remove pits and slice if desired. To prevent darkening, keep peeled fruit in ascorbic acid solution. Prepare and boil a very light, light, or medium syrup or pack apricots in water, apple juice, or white grape juice.

                Raw packs make poor quality apricots.

                Hot pack – In a large saucepan place drained fruit in syrup, water, or juice and bring to boil. Fill jars with hot fruit and cooking liquid, leaving ½-inch headspace. Place halves in layers, cut side down.

                Raw pack – Fill jars with raw fruit, cut side down, and add hot water, juice, or syrup, leaving ½-inch headspace.

                Adjust lids and process.

                Processing directions for canning apricots in a boiling-water canner are given in Table 1.

                Processing directions for canning apricots in a dial or weighted-gauge canner are given in Table 2 and Table 3.Tables info in URL.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select firm, ripe, uniformly yellow apricots. Sort, wash, halve and pit. Peel and slice if desired. If apricots are not peeled, heat them in boiling water 1/2 minute to keep skins from toughening during freezing. Cool in cold water and drain.

                Syrup Pack – Use cold 40 percent syrup. For a better quality frozen product, add 3/4 teaspoon (2250 mg) ascorbic acid to each quart of syrup. Pack apricots directly into containers. Cover with syrup, leaving headspace. Place a small piece of crumpled water-resistant paper on top to hold fruit down. Seal and freeze.

                Sugar Pack – Before combining apricots with sugar, give the fruit the following treatment to prevent darkening:

                Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon (750 mg) ascorbic acid in 3 tablespoons cold water and sprinkle over 1 quart (7/8 pound) of fruit. Mix 1/2 cup sugar with each quart of fruit. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Pack apricots into containers and press down until fruit is covered with juice, leaving headspace. Place a small piece of crumpled water-resistant paper on top to hold fruit down. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>

            <name>Avocados</name>
            <canningMethod>Here’s a quick and easy pickling solution. Multiply by the number of avocados you have.

                Ingredients

                1 ripe but firm avocado
                4 tablespoons vinegar
                2 tablespoons water (optional)
                1 to 2 teaspoons sugar (or to taste)
                1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
                (see variations below)

                Directions

                Choose firm but ripe avocados. Peel, pit, and slice or cube the avocado flesh.
                In a bowl large enough to hold the avocado pieces, stir together vinegar, water, sugar, and salt until sugar and salt are completely dissolved.
                Pour vinegar mixture over slices or cubes of avocado.
                Cover, refrigerate, and use within 3 days.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select avocados that yield to gentle pressure with rinds free from dark blemishes. Peel fruit, cut in half and remove pit.

                Avocados are best frozen as purée – unsweetened for salads and sandwiches, sweetened for other uses. Avocados are not satisfactorily frozen whole or sliced. For a better quality product, add 1/4 teaspoon (750 mg) ascorbic acid to each quart of purée or add 1 tablespoon lemon juice for each 2 avocados.

                Pack into container, leaving headspace. Seal and freeze.

            <name>Chokecherries</name>
            <canningMethod>ChokeCherry Jelly

                Ingredients
                4 cups chokecherry juice
                1/4 cup of lemon juice
                1 1/2– 2 cups sugar OR 1 1/2 cups honey
                4 t. Pomona’s Pectin (like this)
                4 t. calcium water (included in Pomona’s pectin)

                Instructions
                Step 1: *How to Make Chokecherry Juice* If you have a juicer, use it! I don’t, so I use this method:
                Clean, wash, and remove stems from berries
                Place in a large pot filled with enough water to just cover the fruit
                Simmer 15-30 minutes until fruit softens
                Use a potato masher to mash the juice out
                Strain through a cheesecloth-lined colander or jelly strainer
                Save the juice and discard pulp/pits
                Step 2: Mix chokecherry juice, lemon juice, and 4 teaspoons calcium water in a pot
                Thoroughly mix sugar or honey in separate bowl with 4 teaspoons pectin &amp; set aside
                Step 3: Bring juice mixture to a boil
                Add pectin/sugar mixture, mix until completely incorporated, then return to a boil
                Remove from heat, get ready to place it in your sterilized canning jars
                Step 4: Fill the jars, leaving 1/4″ headspace
                Boil in a hot-water bath canner 10 minutes (add an extra minute for every 1,000 feet you are above sea level)</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Preparation – Select bright red, tree ripened cherries. Wash, stem and pit.

                Syrup Pack – Pack cherries into containers and cover with cold 50 per cent syrup. Leave headspace. Seal and freeze.

                Sugar Pack – To 1 quart (1 and 1/3 pounds) cherries add 3/4 cup sugar. Mix until sugar is dissolved. Pack into containers, leaving headspace. Seal and freeze.</freezingMethod>

            <canningMethod>Chicken or Rabbit

                Please read Using Pressure Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

                Procedure: Choose freshly killed and dressed, heathy animals. Large chickens are more flavorful than fryers. Dressed chicken should be chilled for 6 to 12 hours before canning. Dressed rabbits should be soaked 1 hour in water containing 1 tablespoon of salt per quart, and then rinsed. Remove excess fat. Cut the chicken or rabbit into its suitable size parts for fitting into your jars leaving required headspace. Can with or without bones. The hot pack is preferred for best liquid cover and quality during storage. Natural poultry fat and juices are usually not enough to cover the meat in raw packs.

                Hot pack – Boil, steam or bake meat until about two-thirds done. Add 1 teaspoon salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with pieces and hot broth, leaving 1-1/4 inch headspace.

                Raw pack – Add 1 teaspoon salt per quart, if desired. Fill jars loosely with raw meat pieces, leaving 1-1/4 inch headspace. Do not add liquid.

                Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2 according to the canning method used.</canningMethod>
            <freezingMethod>Select only high quality, fresh poultry to freeze. The tender young bird is best for roasting, frying and broiling. Choose the more flavorful older birds for braising or stewing.

                Package poultry in freezer paper or wrap using the drugstore or butcher wrap, or place in freezer bags. Storebought poultry needs to be over-wrapped before freezing because its clear wrap is not moisture-vapor resistant. When packaging pieces, arrange them to form a compact, square, flat package so they will stack better in the freezer. After packaging, seal and freeze immediately.

                Quail, dove, duck, pheasant and other game birds should be dressed and gutted as soon as possible after shooting. Cool and clean properly. Remove excess fat on wild ducks and geese since it becomes rancid very quickly. Freeze as directed for poultry.

                Do not stuff poultry or game birds before freezing them. During freezing or thawing times, bacteria that cause foodborne illness could easily grow in the stuffing. Commercially stuffed frozen poultry is prepared under special safety conditions that cannot be duplicated at home.</freezingMethod>
